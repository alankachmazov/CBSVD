# CBSVD

In this project we recreated a new approach to improve the accuracy and scalability of two factorized collaborative filtering models: SVD++ and Asymmetric-SVD++ suggested by the paper “Clustering-Based Factorized Collaborative Filtering” by Nima Mirbakhsh and Charles X. Ling. The implementation is done using Python (skikit-surprise library).
